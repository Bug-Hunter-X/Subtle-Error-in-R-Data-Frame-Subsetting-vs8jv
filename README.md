This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in R when subsetting data frames using logical operators.  The `bug.R` file contains code with the error, while `bugSolution.R` provides the corrected version. The error involves incorrect use of logical operators in subsetting a data frame.  The solution clarifies how to correctly use these operators to achieve the desired subset.
